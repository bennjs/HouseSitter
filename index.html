                            <p id="groceries" class="hidden-text">Its easiest to use <a href="http://mysupermarket.co.uk">MySupermarket</a> to compare prices on an online shop. All of the big supermarkets deliver to us, but Asda tends to be cheapest on average. If you use my account (it should automatically log you in to MySupermarket and Asda on the PC) you can also use our delivery pass to get free delivery. Last next-day orders are 11:59 on the Asda website.
                            
                            <br><br>There's plenty of shopping in Lewisham, but you have the downside of having to get it home. You can get the 108 bus (on the side opposite from the station) direct to Lewisham Shopping Centre.
                            <br><br>If you get the 108 from the station side it will take you to the Sainsbury's near the cinema. It'll have a larger selection, but is a little further away.
                            <br><br>Alternatively there is a Cost Cutter in Blackheath, but compared to the major supermarkets it's a little pricey.

                            <p id="kodi" class="hidden-text">If you boot up the Fire TV there will be an icon on the Home Page (under the Recent tab) that looks like this:

                            When you click it you'll be taken to the Kodi Desktop. Then you just need to navigate either Films or TV by Title.

                            Just put it back like this and you should be good to go. You might also need to trace the wire down from the window towards the TV to check it's still connected properly.

                            <br><br>To fix this - power the computer down (just hold the power button in for a few seconds). When you turn it back on you're going to babysit it briefly. During the reboot process it'll land on a black screen that asks you to select the operating system you want to load.
                            <br><br>Use the keyboard to scroll down the list to the third or so item which should have "Windows 7" in the title. Hit enter & you're done.
